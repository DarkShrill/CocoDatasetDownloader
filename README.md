COCO represents one of the largest and most popular datasets for computer vision, with thousands of annotated images covering a wide range of objects and scenes. With this project, you can immerse yourself in the universe of computer vision by exploring the images and annotations of the COCO dataset.

The application uses a predefined JSON file that contains the metadata of the images and their annotations, giving you a simple and intuitive way to download and access the information contained in the dataset. With a simple click, you can get the data you need for your machine learning, research or simple exploration activities.

It is important to emphasise that this project was developed purely for educational purposes and for fun. We are passionate about artificial intelligence and created this application to share our passion and provide enthusiasts with an interactive tool for learning and exploring the COCO dataset.

We hope you find this project stimulating and fun to use. Explore the world of images and annotations in the COCO dataset, discover new objects, experiment with computer vision algorithms and share your findings with the community. 

Have fun!
